# Project Scratchpad
**Current Role:** Executor
**MVP Status:** In Progress
**GitHub Repo:** [pending]
**Last Push:** [pending]

## Background and Motivation
Build a Glasses Finder Wizard that guides users through a vision/lifestyle questionnaire and provides AI-powered eyewear recommendations.

## Research Findings
- [See DECISIONS.md and ARCHITECTURE.md for rationale]

## MVP Definition
**Core Features (Build First):**
- [x] Questionnaire wizard UI
- [x] AI-powered recommendations

**Enhancements (Build Later):**
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Add deployment scripts
- [ ] Polish UI/UX and accessibility
- [ ] Add real API integration for optician data

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- Ensuring smooth user experience through wizard steps

## High-level Task Breakdown
- [x] Initialize React project with Vite and TypeScript
- [x] Install dependencies (react, lucide-react, etc.)
- [x] Integrate needs_analysis.tsx as main component
- [x] Create documentation structure (README, ARCHITECTURE, DECISIONS, docs/)
- [ ] Initialize git and push to GitHub

## Project Status Board
### MVP Tasks (Priority: CRITICAL)
